# 🚀 Learning Resources for Rust Timestamp Microservice

## **1️⃣ Core Rust Concepts (Prerequisites)**
- [Let's Get Rusty - Complete Rust Course (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpPEoZW5IiY)  
  ✅ Covers **fundamentals** such as ownership, structs, enums, and error handling.  
  ✅ A great **video-based learning** approach.

- **Rust Book (Official Documentation)**  
  ✅ **[Chapter 4: Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html)** – Crucial for Rust’s memory safety.  
  ✅ **[Chapter 9: Error Handling](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html)** – Essential for building robust applications.  
  ✅ **[Chapter 12: Command Line Project](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html)** – Provides hands-on experience with Rust projects.  
  ✅ **[Chapter 13: Closures and Iterators](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-00-functional-features.html)** – Useful for writing efficient and concise code.

💡 **Verdict**:  
This is an **essential** starting point for anyone learning Rust. It lays a strong foundation for understanding key concepts before diving into more advanced topics.

## **2️⃣ Web Development (Actix-Web & API)**
- **[Actix-web Documentation](https://actix.rs/docs/)**  
  ✅ The **official documentation** for routing, request handling, and middleware.  
  ✅ The **best reference** for Actix-Web projects.

- **[Building REST APIs in Rust (Rocket framework)](https://rocket.rs/guide/getting-started/)**  
  ✅ Rocket is an alternative to Actix, worth exploring.  
  ✅ Helps compare different approaches to API development in Rust.

💡 **Verdict**:  
Actix-Web is **highly recommended** for this project. However, if you want to explore another framework, Rocket is a great alternative.

## **3️⃣ Date & Time Handling (Chrono + Timezones)**
- **[Chrono Crate Documentation](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/)**  
  ✅ The **best Rust library** for date-time operations.  
  ✅ A must-read for parsing dates and handling time zones.

- **[Timezone Handling (chrono-tz)](https://docs.rs/chrono-tz/latest/chrono_tz/)**  
  ✅ Essential for applications requiring **multi-timezone support**.

💡 **Verdict**:  
**Chrono is the gold standard** for handling timestamps in Rust. If your project requires working with multiple time zones, `chrono-tz` is a must-have.

## **4️⃣ Project-Specific Tools (JSON, Testing)**
- **[Serde (JSON Serialization/Deserialization)](https://serde.rs/)**  
  ✅ **Essential for API responses**.  
  ✅ Simplifies the process of serializing and deserializing data.

- **[Rust Testing Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-00-testing.html)**  
  ✅ Covers **unit testing and integration testing** in Rust.

💡 **Verdict**:  
Understanding **Serde and Rust’s testing framework** is crucial for ensuring a robust and well-tested API.
